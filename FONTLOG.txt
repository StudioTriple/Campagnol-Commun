FONTLOG for Foo
-------------------
This file provides detailed information on the Foo font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Foo fonts
and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
--------------------------
(Here is where you would describe the purpose and brief specifications for the
font project, and where users can find more detailed documentation. It can also
include references to how changes can be contributed back to the Original
Version. You may also wish to include a short guide to the design, or a
reference to such a document.) 

Foo currently provides the following Unicode coverage:
Basic Latin: 93/128 (72.66%)
Latin-1 Supplement: 2/128 (1.56%)

Security and Integrity
-------------------------

The following signatures are valid for the source files and the final pdf:
SHA256: ...

As you can see in the corresponding SHA256sum.txt file.

You can check that the orginator of the signature is actually who he said he is by using the following GPG public key:
<key>
